# Web2Native Bridge - Uniting the "Web" and "App" worlds

<table><tr><td><i>Note: this is a system in development, the specification may change anytime without notice</i></td></tr></table>

This repository contains all code for building and testing an <i>emulation</i> of
the Web2Native Bridge concept
(https://cyberphone.github.io/doc/web/web2native-bridge.pdf)
using the Google **Chrome** and Mozilla **Firefox** <i>desktop</i> browsers.  It also runs on the Open Source **Chromium** browser. 

The emulator code exploits Chrome's native messaging (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/nativeMessaging)
featured in a single universal Chrome/Firefox extension.

Applications callable by the Web2Native Bridge emulator must be written in Java and stored in a for the purpose
dedicated directory.

## API
The Web2Native Bridge emulator extends the <code>navigator</code> object by a *single* method<br>
<code>nativeConnect</code>('*Name of target application*' [, *optionalArgument*]) which
returns a JavaScript <code>Promise</code> to a <code>port</code> object.

The <code>port</code> object supports the following methods and events:
* <code>postMessage</code>(*message*)
* <code>disconnect</code>()
* <code>addMessageListener</code>(function(*message*))
* <code>addDisconnectListener</code>(function())

*optionalArgument* and *message* **must** be valid JSON-serializable JavaScript objects.

An example which could be hosted in an ordinary (*non-privileged*) web page:
```javascript
navigator.nativeConnect('com.example.myapp').then(function(port) {

    port.addMessageListener(function(message) {
        // We got a message from the native application...
    });

    port.addDisconnectListener(function() {
        // Native application disconnected...
    });

    port.postMessage({greeting:'Native app, how are you doing?'});
    // Note: JavaScript serialization makes the above a genuine JSON object

    port.disonnect();  // Not much of a conversation going on here...

}, function(err) {
    console.debug(err);
});
```
The argument to <code>nativeConnect</code> holds the name of the specifically adapted local application to invoke.   The current scheme uses a Java-inspired dotted path pointing to a subdirectory and JAR-application having this name.

## Manifest
For specifying access to native applications there **must** be a JSON-formatted *manifest* file associated with each application.
The following *manifest* provides universal access to an application:
```json
{
  "callableFrom": ["*://*/*", "file:///*"]
}
```
A more restrictive *manifest* could limit access to a single domain and https operation:
```json
{
  "callableFrom": ["https://example.com/*", "https://*.example.com/*"]
}
```

## Architecture
The Web2Native Bridge emulator always invokes a central proxy located at <code>proxy/install/w2nb-proxy</code>.<br>

The proxy in turn dispatches a call to the specific target application located at<br><code>
proxy/install/apps/</code>*dottedpath*<code>/</code>*dottedpath*<code>.jar</code>.

The mandatory *manifest* file is stored at<br><code>
proxy/install/apps/</code>*dottedpath*<code>/manifest.json</code>.

Common Java libraries may be stored in <code>proxy/install/libs</code>.

For debugging purposes there is also a logging system writing data in <code>proxy/install/logs</code>.

All local I/O between the browser, proxy and the callable applications
is performed through <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code>.

## Native Application Interface
Native applications (in the prototype Java applications hosted in JAR-files) are called as follows:
<table>
<tr><td>args[0]</td><td>Absolute path to the proxy/install directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>args[1]</td><td>Application name (dotted path)</td></tr>
<tr><td>args[2]</td><td>URL of calling web page</td></tr>
<tr><td>args[3]</td><td>Coordinates of calling web page</td></tr>
<tr><td>args[4]</td><td>Custom invocation data (<i>OptionalArgument</i>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>args[5...]</td><td>Chrome's Native Messaging arguments</td></tr>
</table>

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* You need to have **Java SE version 8** installed to run the Web2Native Bridge emulator
* OS/X and Linux installations presume that **clang** respectively **g++** is available
* Clone the **web2native-bridge** master repository or just download the ZIP via GitHub to any free directory

Note: If you are using Oracle Java you must install the **Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files** as well.

### Chrome/Chromium specific steps
1. Start a terminal window and move to <code>proxy/install</code>. Then run the <code>install-proxy</code> script that suits your platform
2. Install the Web2Native Bridge browser extension from the Chrome Web Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web2native-bridge-emulato/jphfmfbdedghfhhjijaogeloiehomfni
3. In Chrome, go to Settings->Extensions and check "Allow access to file URLs" for the Web2Native Bridge extension 

### Firefox specific steps
1. Start a terminal window and move to <code>firefox/install</code>. Then run the <code>install-proxy</code> script that suits your platform
2. Install the Web2Native Bridge browser extension from the file <code>firefox/install/xpi/web2native_bridge_emulator-1.0.xpi</code> using the Firefox menu option: *Add-ons->Extensions->Install Add-on from file*.

### Testing the installation
Now you can try the two sample applications (see next sections) since they are installed by default.

Please don't hesitate contacting me if you run into problems during installation or execution of the emulator!

## Basic Sample Application
The HTML file <code>sample1/demo/sample1.html</code> does approximately
the same thing as the application depicted in
http://www.cnet.com/news/google-paves-over-hole-left-by-chrome-plug-in-ban/
albeit with a few significant enhancements:
* The sample application is invoked by an ordinary web page
* The Web2Native Bridge browser extension is fully generic and can support any number of very different applications
* The Web2Native Bridge adds positioning support enabling alignment UI-wise with the web  

The native part of the sample application resides in <code>proxy/install/apps/org.webpki.w2nb.sample1/org.webpki.w2nb.sample1.jar</code>.

## Single Page Application
Although not a design goal, the Web2Native Bridge API is also compliant with the SPA concept:<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application

## Security Considerations
Since an emulator *by definition* isn't the "real thing" some limitations apply. That is, the Web2Native Bridge
emulator is *not intended for production* since it doesn't support the following security measures:
* Native application vetting infrastructure. An improperly designed native message extension could enable web access to the entire computer!
* HTTPS information
* Site-blocking support and associated administration
 
Although not entirely comforting, Chrome's native messaging framework also lacks these qualities...

In addition, the scheme injects code in every web page visited which is a core "feature" of Chrome extensions
slowing down execution.  It is probably wise disabling the extension (using Chrome *settings*) when not using it.
